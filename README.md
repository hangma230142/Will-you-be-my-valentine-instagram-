# 💌 Will You Be My Valentine?

A fun and interactive webpage to ask someone to be your Valentine! Inspired by [the_coding_wizard](#), this project adds a playful touch to popping the big question.

---

## 🌟 How It Works

The page features a **"Yes"** and **"No"** button. But here's the twist:

- Clicking **"No"** keeps changing the button text with different messages.
- Clicking **"Yes"** takes the user to a cute confirmation page.
- The **"Yes"** button also grows bigger with each "No" click, making it harder to resist!

💡 *Designed to be simple, fun, and work on all screen sizes!*
